              Our Sunday services include vibrant worship music, inspiring
              sermons, and a welcoming community. Services typically last about
              an hour and a half and include singing, prayer, scripture reading,
              and a message from our pastor. We also have programs for children
              and youth during this time.

            <p>
              No, there is no dress code at our church. We encourage you to come
              as you are, whether that means dressing casually or more formally.
              Our focus is on worship and community, not on what you wear.

              Absolutely! We offer a variety of programs for children of all
              ages. During our Sunday services, we have a children's ministry
              that provides age-appropriate lessons and activities. We also have
              a nursery for infants and toddlers.

              We believe in the Trinity: one God in three persons â€“ Father, Son,
              and Holy Spirit. We believe that salvation is a gift from God
              through faith in Jesus Christ. We also believe that the Bible is
              the inspired Word of God and serves as our guide for faith and
              practice. For more detailed information, please visit our "What We
              Believe" page.
