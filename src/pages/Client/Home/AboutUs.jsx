              <b>Our Mission</b> <br />
              To glorify God by making disciples of all nations, building a
              loving community, and serving those in need. <br /> <br />

              <b> What We Believe</b>
              <br />
              The Trinity: We believe in one God, eternally existing in three
              persons â€“ Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Salvation: We believe that
              salvation is a gift from God, received through faith in Jesus
              Christ. The Bible: We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word
              of God, serving as our guide for faith and practice. The Church:
              We believe the Church is the body of Christ, called to worship God
              and serve humanity.
